# üé® Java ASCII Art Generator
This project is an ASCII art generator developed by [**Noam Kimhi**](https://github.com/noam-kimhi) and [**Or Forshmit**](https://github.com/OrF8) as part of the course [**67125 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming**](https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/67125/2/2025/) at [**The Hebrew University of Jerusalem**](https://en.huji.ac.il/). \
The application converts images into ASCII art representations using Java. \
The project recieved a final grade of **100**.

# üß© Features
- **Image to ASCII Conversion**: Transforms images into ASCII art using grayscale mapping.
- **Customizable Character Sets**: Allows selection of different character sets for varying levels of detail.
- **Scalable Output**: Adjusts the size of the output ASCII art based on user preferences.
- **Modular Design**: Structured codebase for easy maintenance and extension.
