# QUESTION 1 - Description of every class in our program and the relationships between them:
Classes:
(*) SubImgCharMatcher: This class is responsible for matching an ASCII character to a sub-image with a given
                       brightness.
    TODO: Add description for CharBrightnessMatcher after deciding if its a nested class or not.

Relationships:
(*) SubImgCharMatcher is a part of the ASCII-art algorithm logic, dividing a full-size picture to sub-images
    and assigning each of them a character that represent them according to their brightness.

# QUESTION 2 - Details about every Java data structure we used in our code, and the reasons behind the choice:
TODO: Don't forget to mention time and space complexity in our answer!
(*) Part 1.1 - ASCII Character set: We decided to use a HashMap to store the brightness value of each
               character. The options we had were either a HashMap or a TreeMap due to the need to print the
               characters in their ASCII order. However, the frequency of this operation is negligible and
               will only be requested upon a user's request, while the need to get/set the brightness value
               of a character will be in a greater demand throughout the ASCII-Art generating process. A Hash-
               Map enables access to the brightness value of each character in constant time (amortized).
               On the other hand, a TreeMap is not Hash-based, therefor accessing the brightness values will
               be on O(log n) time, and will only make sorting the keys more efficient (which as we explained,
               is far less important). Space-complexity wise, a HashMap is also ideal for this situation, and
               will store our data on O(n) space (where n is the number of characters). In this case there
               were no differences between a TreeMap and a HashMap.
               TODO: Where did we use this ASCII character set?
